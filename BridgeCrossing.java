### **Problem Statement**:
You are tasked with finding the maximum number of mangoes that can be loaded onto a truck while ensuring that the total weight (truck + mangoes) does not exceed the weight capacity of a bridge.

Given:
1. **a**: The weight of one mango (in kilograms).
2. **b**: The weight of the truck (in kilograms).
3. **c**: The maximum weight capacity of the bridge (in kilograms).

### **Input Format**:
- A single line containing three integers: `a` (weight of one mango), `b` (weight of the truck), and `c` (weight capacity of the bridge).

### **Output Format**:
- Print the maximum number of mangoes that can be loaded on the truck so it can cross the bridge safely.

---

### **Solution Explanation**:
1. **Remaining Capacity**: 
   - The remaining capacity for mangoes is the difference between the bridge's weight capacity and the truck's weight:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Capacity} = c - b
     \]
   - If the truck's weight (`b`) exceeds or equals the bridge's capacity (`c`), no mangoes can be loaded.

2. **Maximum Mangoes**:
   - If the remaining capacity is positive, calculate how many mangoes can fit within that capacity:
     \[
     \text{Maximum Mangoes} = \frac{\text{Remaining Capacity}}{\text{Weight of One Mango}}
     \]
   - Use integer division (`/`) to ensure that the number of mangoes is an integer.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `b >= c`, output `0` because the truck alone is too heavy for the bridge.
   - If `a > c - b`, output `0` because even one mango cannot fit within the remaining capacity.

### **Dry Run**:

#### Test Case 1:
**Input**:
```
2 5 11
```

**Steps**:
1. **Remaining Capacity**: `c - b = 11 - 5 = 6`.
2. **Maximum Mangoes**: `6 / 2 = 3`.

**Output**:
```
3
```

---

#### Test Case 2:
**Input**:
```
3 8 15
```

**Steps**:
1. **Remaining Capacity**: `c - b = 15 - 8 = 7`.
2. **Maximum Mangoes**: `7 / 3 = 2`.

**Output**:
```
2
```

---

#### Test Case 3:
**Input**:
```
4 10 9
```

**Steps**:
1. **Remaining Capacity**: `c - b = 9 - 10 = -1` (negative).
2. Since the remaining capacity is less than or equal to zero, output `0`.

**Output**:
```
0
```

---

### **Conclusion**:
The solution calculates the remaining capacity after accounting for the truck's weight and determines how many mangoes can fit within that capacity. The logic ensures that the truck and mangoes' combined weight never exceeds the bridge's weight limit.*/
