Hereâ€™s the **Problem Statement**, **Solution Explanation**, and **Dry Run** with comments for your code:

```java
import java.io.*; 
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* 
         * Problem Statement:
         * Vignesh has X pending assignments. Each assignment takes Y minutes to complete.
         * Vignesh has Z days to complete all the assignments.
         * Determine if Vignesh can complete all assignments within Z days.
         * 
         * We are given:
         * - X: Number of assignments
         * - Y: Time (in minutes) to complete one assignment
         * - Z: Number of days available to complete all assignments
         * 
         * Output:
         * Print "YES" if Vignesh can complete all assignments within Z days, otherwise print "NO".
         * 
         * Constraints:
         * 1 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^5
         * 
         * Example:
         * Input: 5 5 5
         * Output: YES
         * 
         * Explanation:
         * Vignesh has 5 assignments, each taking 5 minutes. 
         * Total time to complete = 5 * 5 = 25 minutes.
         * Vignesh has 5 days, i.e., 5 * 24 * 60 = 7200 minutes.
         * Since 25 minutes is less than 7200 minutes, the output is "YES".

### **Solution Explanation**:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - We are given three integers: `a` (number of assignments), `b` (time per assignment), and `c` (number of available days).
   
2. **Calculation**:
   - The **total time required** to complete all assignments is calculated by multiplying the number of assignments (`a`) by the time per assignment (`b`):
     \[
     \text{totalTime} = a \times b
     \]
   - The **available time** is the number of days (`c`) converted into minutes:
     \[
     \text{availableTime} = c \times 24 \times 60
     \]
     (since 1 day = 24 hours and 1 hour = 60 minutes).

3. **Comparison**:
   - We compare the total time required (`totalTime`) with the available time (`availableTime`).
   - If the total time required is less than or equal to the available time, we print "YES".
   - Otherwise, we print "NO".

### **Dry Run**:

#### Test Case 1:

**Input**:
```
5 5 5
```

**Execution**:
- `a = 5` (number of assignments),
- `b = 5` (time per assignment in minutes),
- `c = 5` (number of available days).
- Calculate the total time required to complete all assignments:
  \[
  \text{totalTime} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Calculate the total available time in minutes:
  \[
  \text{availableTime} = 5 \times 24 \times 60 = 7200 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Since 25 minutes is less than or equal to 7200 minutes, the output is "YES".

**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test Case 2:

**Input**:
```
1000 20 10
```

**Execution**:
- `a = 1000` (number of assignments),
- `b = 20` (time per assignment in minutes),
- `c = 10` (number of available days).
- Calculate the total time required to complete all assignments:
  \[
  \text{totalTime} = 1000 \times 20 = 20000 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Calculate the total available time in minutes:
  \[
  \text{availableTime} = 10 \times 24 \times 60 = 14400 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Since 20000 minutes is greater than 14400 minutes, the output is "NO".

**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test Case 3:

**Input**:
```
10 10 2
```

**Execution**:
- `a = 10` (number of assignments),
- `b = 10` (time per assignment in minutes),
- `c = 2` (number of available days).
- Calculate the total time required to complete all assignments:
  \[
  \text{totalTime} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Calculate the total available time in minutes:
  \[
  \text{availableTime} = 2 \times 24 \times 60 = 2880 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Since 100 minutes is less than 2880 minutes, the output is "YES".

**Output**:
```
YES
```

### **Conclusion**:
This problem involves calculating the total time required to complete all assignments and comparing it with the available time. The dry run and code logic show how the calculation works and how the solution handles different inputs. The approach is efficient, given the problem constraints.
